## Common configuration that impacts all components in the chart

## The matrix-tools image, used in multiple components
matrixTools:

  # Details of the image to be used
  image:
    ## The host and (optional) port of the container image registry for this component.
    ## If not specified Docker Hub is implied
    registry: ghcr.io

    ## The path in the registry where the container image is located
    repository: element-hq/ess-helm/matrix-tools

    ## The tag of the container image to use.
    ## Defaults to the Chart's appVersion if not set
    tag: "0.3.0"

    ## Container digest to use. Used to pull the image instead of the image tag / Chart appVersion if set
    # digest:

    ## Whether the image should be pulled on container startup. Valid values are Always, IfNotPresent and Never
    ## If this isn't provided it defaults to Always when using the image tag / Chart appVersion or
    ## IfNotPresent if using a digest
    # pullPolicy:

    ## A list of pull secrets to use for this image
    ## e.g.
    ## pullSecrets:
    ## - name: dockerhub
    pullSecrets: []

## CertManager Issuer to configure by default automatically on all ingresses
## If configured, the chart will automatically generate the tlsSecret name for all ingresses
certManager: {}
  ## Choose one of clusterIssuer or issuer
  # clusterIssuer:
  # issuer:

## The server name of the Matrix Stack. This gets embedded in user IDs & room IDs
## It can not change after the initial deployment.
# serverName: ess.localhost

## Labels to add to all manifest for all components in this chart
labels: {}

## How all ingresses should be constructed by default, unless overridden
ingress:
  ## Annotations to be added to all Ingresses. Will be merged with component specific Ingress annotations

  # tlsSecret:

  ## How the Services behind all Ingresses is constructed by default

## A list of Secrets in this namespace to use as pull Secrets.
## Ignored if a given component specifies its own pull Secrets.

## imagePullSecrets:
## - name: ess-pull-secret

## Workload tolerations allows Pods that are part of a (sub)component to 'tolerate' any taint that matches the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.
##
## * effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
## * key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
## * operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
## * value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
##
## * tolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

      ## Whether a ServiceAccount should be created by the chart or not
      create: true

    ## Workload tolerations allows Pods that are part of this (sub)component to 'tolerate' any taint that matches the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.
    ##
    ## * effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
    ## * key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
    ## * operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
    ## * value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
    ##
    ## * tolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
    ## e.g.
    ## tolerations:
    ## - effect:
    ##   key:
    ##   operator:
    ##   value:

    tolerations: []
