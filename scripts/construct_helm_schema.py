# Implements the visitor pattern over a JSON schema to return a mutated JSON schema.
#
# For a given JSON schema fragment a function will be called to either mutate or remove
# this schema fragment (or parts of it).
# - For schema fragments that are objects, each sub-property will be recursively mutated
#   after the fragment itself has been mutated
# - For schema fragments that are arrays, the type of the array will be recursively mutated
#   after the fragment itself has been mutated
# - For schema fragments that are scalars, the value after mutation is simply returned
